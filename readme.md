### [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
A good package for unit tests.

### [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/guide/)
Well documented, lightweight, easy to use and unit test.

### [Validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator)
Echo doesnâ€™t have built-in data validation capabilities, so I use this third-party library.
